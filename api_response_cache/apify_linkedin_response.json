We have also created a central performance engineering team, where we will drive shared tools, dashboarding capabilities, measurement frameworks, analytical capabilities and skills.

  "companyDescription": "Code for Africa (CfA) uses technology and #OpenData to build digital democracies that empower citizens.\n\nWe give citizens actionable information for better-informed decision making and digital tools to amplify their voices, so that they can hold the authorities (both governmental and corporate) to account.\n\nWe do this in a number of ways: first, by liberating the data currently locked up in governments and corporations, and using this information to build open data / open government digital \"backbone\"​ infrastructure. \n\nSecond, we embed technologists into frontline civic watchdogs, the mass media, public entities, and grassroots citizen organisations to help create the tools, skills, and data necessary to engage meaningfully with the power elite. \n\nAnd, third, we foster civic engagement by incubating digital storytellers and amplifying citizen voices, building digital democracy services that encourage active citizenry, and supporting evidence-based public discourse.\n\nWe have over 140 full-time in-country staff at innovation labs in 28 African countries: Bénin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), Côte d’Ivoire, Chad, DRC, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinée, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Niger, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zimbabwe. And, we have a small number of staff in non-African countries, including Georgia, Italy and the USA. CfA also has active projects in a further five African countries.\n\nCfA is funded by a coalition of human rights defending philanthropies, global technology platforms, media organisations and citizen watchdog bodies interested in public accountability.",

  "descriptionHtml": "This is a general track for first-level engineering management positions at Canonical.<br><br>We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of 'most software to most companies'. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.<br><br>We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products, and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team's direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills, and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.<br><br>A typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone such as EMEA or Americas or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery.

  "descriptionText": "This is a general track for first-level engineering management positions at Canonical.We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of 'most software to most companies'. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products, and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team's direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills, and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.A typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone such as EMEA or Americas or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery. They will both be expected to take management training at Canonical so they speak the same language when it comes to team behaviours, habits, routines, norms and standards, but they focus on different sides of the problem.An Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance.

Work in Rust and bring your expert knowledge of VMM and related kernel networking and storage capabilities.Docker images are easy to make and publish on Docker Hub and other registries, but the quality, consistency and security maintenance of those images is broadly very poor. Canonical is in a good position to publish a portfolio of outstanding Docker images. Our Rockcraft team is designing and implementing an elevated Docker image experience for the open source community.LXD is a modern system container and virtual machine manager that is widely used on Ubuntu, ChromeOS and other Linux platforms. LXD engineering spans the entire software stack from low-level kernel work on namespaces, confinement, security, filesystems, VMMs and networking, to the high level management REST API and CLI.Members of the Kubernetes product team build MicroK8s for on-rails K8s, and Charmed Kubernetes for more sophisticated integration. We work on K8s itself and on the operations tooling around it.The OpenStack team deliver Charmed OpenStack, OVN / OVS and Ceph. This work brings cloud platform technologies to large-scale computing environments.These teams hire system level C/C++, Golang, Rust and Python developers to work on security-critical, performance-critical and mission-critical code, focused on software delivery, containers, security, sandboxing, application orchestration and management. Our teams are motivated to have a meaningful impact on modern cloud computing technologies.Location: we have remote container and virt engineering roles in every time zone.What you will focus onDesign and specify new features, building consensus on approachEngage with upstream communities in your area of expertiseConduct security analysis and reviews to ensure defence in depthCreate and monitor performance benchmarks to optimise your productCollaborate proactively with a distributed teamWrite high quality code to create new featuresDebug issues and produce high quality code to fix themReview code produced by other engineersDiscuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutionsWhat we are looking for in youAn exceptional academic track record from both high school and universityUndergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative pathDrive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectationsYou have worked on open source virt or container techYou have experience working in the kernel or very low level systemProfessional written and spoken English Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred) Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation Excellent communication and presentation skills Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks eachAdditional Skills We ValuePerformance engineering and security experienceWhat we offer youWe consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide.

  "companyDescription": "Crossover is a global recruitment company, founded in 2014. We're the world's largest recruiter that specializes in elite full-time remote jobs, hiring the top 1% of tech talent from every corner of the planet.\n\nWe find awesome talent in overlooked places, by posting jobs all over the world, and giving everyone an equal opportunity to prove their skills are world-class. Our system of AI-powered assessments is based on objective factors that are scientifically proven to predict high performance (e.g. cognitive aptitude).\n\n𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐅𝐔𝐋 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒:\n🧑 Reviews from people we've hired:   crossover.com/reviews\n💼 Current openings:   crossover.com/jobs\n💎 Hire someone for your company:   crossover.com/hire\n♟️ How the process works:   crossover.com/selection-process\n❓ FAQs:   crossover.com/help\n~~~\n𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.\n\nAllow us to clarify some common misconceptions:\n1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.\n2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).\n3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.\n\nIt's hard, but it's worth it!",

You’ll be developing and deploying AI-powered features, using cutting-edge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for automated defect detection, and ensuring every release is smooth—zero outages, zero disruptions, zero excuses. If you're looking for a job where you spend weeks debating architecture decisions instead of shipping, this isn’t it.If you’re ready to push the boundaries of AI-driven software engineering and accelerate your career into high-scale cloud-native development, apply now. If you prefer sticking to what you already know, writing test cases by hand, or working in teams that are afraid of automation, this isn’t for you.What You Will Be DoingUsing analysis tools and RAG vector stores to identify, diagnose, and correct product defects and fix bugs.Leveraging AI development agents to design, develop, and deploy innovative features for cloud-native applications.Collaborating with a global team to deliver high-quality, enterprise-grade solutions.What You Won’t Be DoingRoutine Monotony: We keep cumbersome infrastructure tasks to a minimum so you can focus on creating innovative solutions.Endless Meetings: We value your expertise in development over sitting in meeting rooms.

  "companyDescription": "Crossover is a global recruitment company, founded in 2014. We're the world's largest recruiter that specializes in elite full-time remote jobs, hiring the top 1% of tech talent from every corner of the planet.\n\nWe find awesome talent in overlooked places, by posting jobs all over the world, and giving everyone an equal opportunity to prove their skills are world-class. Our system of AI-powered assessments is based on objective factors that are scientifically proven to predict high performance (e.g. cognitive aptitude).\n\n𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐅𝐔𝐋 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒:\n🧑 Reviews from people we've hired:   crossover.com/reviews\n💼 Current openings:   crossover.com/jobs\n💎 Hire someone for your company:   crossover.com/hire\n♟️ How the process works:   crossover.com/selection-process\n❓ FAQs:   crossover.com/help\n~~~\n𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.\n\nAllow us to clarify some common misconceptions:\n1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.\n2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).\n3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.\n\nIt's hard, but it's worth it!",
