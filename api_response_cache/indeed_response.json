  "description": "Yesterday\nC\nEngineering Manager\nCanonical\nLagos\nConfidential\nMinimum Qualification :\nJob Description/Requirements\n\nThis is a general track for first-level engineering management positions at Canonical.\n\nWe believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of 'most software to most companies'. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.\n\nWe believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products, and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team's direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills, and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.\n\nA typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone such as EMEA or Americas or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery. They will both be expected to take management training at Canonical so they speak the same language when it comes to team behaviours, habits, routines, norms and standards, but they focus on different sides of the problem.\n\nAn Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your team and product from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams and customers are all critical to success in this role.\n\nWe have open manager roles across a wide range of engineering domains, including:\n\nPython and Golang\nC / C++ / Rust\nData infrastructure\nHTML / CSS / JavaScript / Typescript / React\nFlutter\nDistro packaging and systems\nSAAS and web microservices\nKernel\nServers\nGraphics, Browser and Desktop\nSilicon enablement and embedded devices\nProduct Security\n\nIf your domain of expertise isn't listed above, yet you feel it's relevant to Canonical, then feel free to apply anyway. We will route you to the most suitable team.\n\nLocation: we have engineering management positions open in every time zone\n\nWhat you'll do\n\nLead and develop a team of engineers, ranging from graduate to senior\nWork remotely in a single major time zone, sometimes two\nCoach, mentor, and offer career development feedback\nIdentify and measure team health indicators\nImplement disciplined engineering processes\nRepresent your team and product to stakeholders, partners, and customers\nDevelop and evangelise great engineering and organisational practices\nPlan and manage progress on agreed goals and projects\nBe an active part of the leadership team, collaborating with other leaders\n\nWhat we're looking for in you\n\nAn exceptional academic track record from both high school and university\nUndergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path\nDrive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations\nExcellent verbal and written communication skills in English\nA love of developing and growing people and a track record of it\nExperience in leading, coaching and mentoring software developers\nOrganised and able to ensure your team delivers timely, high quality results\nWell-organised, self-starting and able to deliver to schedule\nProfessional manner interacting with colleagues, partners, and community\nYou have advanced expertise in your own domain\nYou are knowledgeable and passionate about software development\nYou have solid experience working in an agile development environment\nYou have a demonstrated drive for continual learning\nBuilds trust, relationships and confidence\nResult-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments\nAbility to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each\n\nAdditional Skills We Value\n\nExperience in a developer advocacy or community role\nOps and system administration experience\nPerformance engineering and security experience\n\nWhat we offer you\n\nWe consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.\n\nDistributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person\nPersonal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year\nAnnual compensation review\nRecognition rewards\nAnnual holiday leave\nMaternity and paternity leave\nEmployee Assistance Programme\nOpportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues\nPriority Pass, and travel upgrades for long haul company events\n\nAbout Canonical\n\nCanonical is a pioneering tech firm at the forefront of the global move to open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are changing the world on a daily basis. We recruit on a global basis and set a very high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence - in order to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do. Canonical has been a remote-first company since its inception in 2004. Working here is a step into the future, and will challenge you to think differently, work smarter, learn new skills, and raise your game.\n\nCanonical is an equal opportunity employer\n\nWe are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products. Whatever your identity, we will give your application fair consideration.\n\n<",

    "companyDescription": "IDT was founded by entrepreneur Howard Jonas in August 1990. He founded the company after opening a sales office in Israel, receiving large international phone bills and then discovering a way to lower them by re-originating calls in the United States. In 1996, IDT founded Net2Phone, the world's fourth-largest VoIP provider (2017), and sold an unnamed share of Net2Phone in August 2000 to AT&T for $1.1 billion in cash.\r\nOn February 17, 2006, IDT announced it would reacquire full ownership of Net2Phone, a company it had launched in the mid-1990s.\r\nIn 2007, IDT would acquire a 53% majority interest in a comic book, graphic novel, art book, and comic strip collection publisher Idea and Design Works, now IDW Media Holdings.\r\nIn 2009, IDT introduced Boss Revolution, a PIN-less international prepaid calling service. Boss Revolution PIN-less allows smartphone users to make single touch international calls. Since its introduction, Boss Revolution and other PIN-less providers have largely supplanted the traditional prepaid international calling card industry. IDT subsequently announced initiatives to add various payment services to the Boss Revolution Platform, including international money transfer and cell phone service through Boss Revolution Mobile.\r\nOn October 31, 2011, IDT spun off its energy-related businesses to its shareholders as Genie Energy (NYSE: GNE).\r\nIn 2015, IDT launched National Retail Solutions (NRSPlus.com).\r\nIn January 2017, Net2Phone, subsidiary of IDT Corporation, acquired LiveNinja, a Miami-based messaging and live chat technology startup. LiveNinja’s messaging technology is currently being integrated into its new product now in development. Leveraging LiveNinja’s technology, net2phone will offer a multi-channel platform for Small and medium-sized enterprises that spans phone, messaging, SMS and web chat. The IDT-owned building at 520 Broad Street in downtown Newark was home to the former Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company from 1957 to 2000.\r\nJanuary 2018, IDT began a pilot test on using Ripple's native asset XRP. The aim to simplify cross-border payments, in order to free up billions held in foreign Vostro accounts.
