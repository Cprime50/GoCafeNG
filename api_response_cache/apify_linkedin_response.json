  "companyDescription": "Crossover is a global recruitment company, founded in 2014. We're the world's largest recruiter that specializes in elite full-time remote jobs, hiring the top 1% of tech talent from every corner of the planet.\n\nWe find awesome talent in overlooked places, by posting jobs all over the world, and giving everyone an equal opportunity to prove their skills are world-class. Our system of AI-powered assessments is based on objective factors that are scientifically proven to predict high performance (e.g. cognitive aptitude).\n\n𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐅𝐔𝐋 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒:\n🧑 Reviews from people we've hired:   crossover.com/reviews\n💼 Current openings:   crossover.com/jobs\n💎 Hire someone for your company:   crossover.com/hire\n♟️ How the process works:   crossover.com/selection-process\n❓ FAQs:   crossover.com/help\n~~~\n𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.\n\nAllow us to clarify some common misconceptions:\n1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.\n2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).\n3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.\n\nIt's hard, but it's worth it!",

Our team builds, tests, and publishes the base Ubuntu images used by millions to ensure optimal performance and security in their cloud estate. We aim to deliver the very best public cloud VM experience, as well as specialized images for specific purposes on each cloud.We work closely with Amazon, Microsoft, Google and other world-class cloud partners to optimise Ubuntu for their infrastructure. Our goal is to celebrate and enable their particular points of differentiation on their clouds, while also ensure a common operating experience for their users.As an engineering manager you need to bring both technical and management skills to the leadership of your team. You will also need to represent the team in direct partner engagement. You'll be responsible for the stability and functionality that our cloud users have come to expect.

This will allow companies to run very efficient bare-metal operations for high-performance computing, private cloud, data lakes, AI/ML, and analytics.

  "companyDescription": "Crossover is a global recruitment company, founded in 2014. We're the world's largest recruiter that specializes in elite full-time remote jobs, hiring the top 1% of tech talent from every corner of the planet.\n\nWe find awesome talent in overlooked places, by posting jobs all over the world, and giving everyone an equal opportunity to prove their skills are world-class. Our system of AI-powered assessments is based on objective factors that are scientifically proven to predict high performance (e.g. cognitive aptitude).\n\n𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐅𝐔𝐋 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒:\n🧑 Reviews from people we've hired:   crossover.com/reviews\n💼 Current openings:   crossover.com/jobs\n💎 Hire someone for your company:   crossover.com/hire\n♟️ How the process works:   crossover.com/selection-process\n❓ FAQs:   crossover.com/help\n~~~\n𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.\n\nAllow us to clarify some common misconceptions:\n1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.\n2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).\n3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.\n\nIt's hard, but it's worth it!",

We're the world's largest recruiter that specializes in elite full-time remote jobs, hiring the top 1% of tech talent from every corner of the planet.\n\nWe find awesome talent in overlooked places, by posting jobs all over the world, and giving everyone an equal opportunity to prove their skills are world-class. Our system of AI-powered assessments is based on objective factors that are scientifically proven to predict high performance (e.g. cognitive aptitude).\n\n𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐅𝐔𝐋 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒:\n🧑 Reviews from people we've hired:   crossover.com/reviews\n💼 Current openings:   crossover.com/jobs\n💎 Hire someone for your company:   crossover.com/hire\n♟️ How the process works:   crossover.com/selection-process\n❓ FAQs:   crossover.com/help\n~~~\n𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.\n\nAllow us to clarify some common misconceptions:\n1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.\n2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).\n3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.\n\nIt's hard, but it's worth it!",

  "companyDescription": "Crossover is a global recruitment company, founded in 2014. We're the world's largest recruiter that specializes in elite full-time remote jobs, hiring the top 1% of tech talent from every corner of the planet.\n\nWe find awesome talent in overlooked places, by posting jobs all over the world, and giving everyone an equal opportunity to prove their skills are world-class. Our system of AI-powered assessments is based on objective factors that are scientifically proven to predict high performance (e.g. cognitive aptitude).\n\n𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐅𝐔𝐋 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒:\n🧑 Reviews from people we've hired:   crossover.com/reviews\n💼 Current openings:   crossover.com/jobs\n💎 Hire someone for your company:   crossover.com/hire\n♟️ How the process works:   crossover.com/selection-process\n❓ FAQs:   crossover.com/help\n~~~\n𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.\n\nAllow us to clarify some common misconceptions:\n1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.\n2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).\n3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.\n\nIt's hard, but it's worth it!",
