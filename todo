 Rate Limiting
Add rate limiting to your middleware to restrict the number of requests that can be made using the API key within a specific time frame.
This prevents abuse even if the key is leaked.
2. IP Whitelisting
Restrict access to your API to specific IP addresses or ranges. This ensures that only requests from trusted sources are allowed.
3. Key Rotation
Implement a mechanism to rotate API keys periodically. This reduces the risk of long-term exposure if a key is leaked.
4. Scope and Permissions
Assign scopes or permissions to API keys. For example, limit what actions a specific key can perform.
5. HMAC Validation
Use a server-side secret to validate requests. For example, require the client to sign requests with a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) using the API key and a timestamp.
6. Audit and Logging
Log all requests and monitor for unusual activity, such as requests from unexpected IPs or high request rates.
Would you like me to implement any of these strategies in your APIKeyAuthMiddleware? If so, let me know which one(s) you'd like to prioritize!

i added gemini api key GEMINI_API_KEY= in .env use it to get all the job description and send them as one prompt to get a better format for the job decsription

build the nextjs project to be ready for deployment as i am abou to deploy it on vercel and what are the steps i should follow
